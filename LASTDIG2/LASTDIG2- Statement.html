<p style="text-align: justify;">Pappu was doing the work of his math class about three days but he is tired of make operations a lot and he should deliver his task tomorrow. His math’s teacher gives two numbers a and b. The problem consist in find the last digit of the potency of base a and index b. Help Pappu with his problem. You are given two integer numbers: the base a (number of digits d, such that 1&lt;=d&lt;=1000) and the index b (0 &lt;= b &lt;= 922*10^15). You<br>have to find the last digit of a^b.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">                                                         <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Input</strong></span><br>The first line of input contains an integer t, the number of test cases (t &lt;= 30). t test cases follow. For<br>each test case will appear a and b separated by space.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">                                                         <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Output</strong></span><br>For each test case output an integer per line representing the result.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Example</strong></span><br>Input:<br>3<br>3 10<br>6 2<br>150 53<br>Output:<br>9<br>6<br>0</p>
