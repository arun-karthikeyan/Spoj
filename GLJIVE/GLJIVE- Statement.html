<p>In front of Super Mario there are 10 mushrooms, arranged in a row. A certain amount of points is<br>awarded for picking each of the mushrooms. Super Mario must pick mushrooms in order they appear,<br>but is not required to pick them all â€“ his goal is to score a number of points as close as possible to<br>100.<br>In case there exist two such numbers which are equally close to 100 (e.g. 98 and 102), Mario will pick<br>the greater one (in this case 102).<br>Help Super Mario and tell him how many points he will score.</p>
