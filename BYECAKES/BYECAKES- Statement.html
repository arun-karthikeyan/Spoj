<p>John is moving to a different city and he wants to use all his perishable food before doing it,<br>to avoid wasting. Luckily all he has now is eggs, flour, sugar and milk, so he is going to make<br>his famous cakes and give them to his friends as a goodbye gift.<br>John only knows how to make an entire cake and not half a cake, a third of a cake, or any<br>other portion. So, he will buy whatever is needed of each ingredient so that he can make an<br>integer number of cakes and have nothing left. Of course, he wants to spend as little money as<br>possible. You must help John to decide how much he should buy of each ingredient.</p> 
<h3>Input</h3> 
<p>The input contains several test cases. Each test case is described in a single line that contains<br>eight integers E, F , S, M , E' , F' , S' and M' separated by single spaces. Values E and E' are<br>numbers of eggs, F and F' are grams of flour, S and S' are grams of sugar, and M and M' are<br>centiliters of milk. For each ingredient, X is the amount John has (0 ≤ X ≤ 1000), while X' is<br>the amount needed to make a single cake (1 ≤ X ≤ 1000). The last line of the input contains<br>the number −1 eight times separated by single spaces and should not be processed as a test<br>case.</p> 
<h3>Output</h3> 
<p>For each test case output a single line with four non-negative integers separated by single spaces,<br>representing the amount of each ingredient John needs to buy, in the same order and units as<br>the input.</p>
