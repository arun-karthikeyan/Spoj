<p>Arithmatic and geometric Progressions are 2 of the well known progressions in maths.</p> 
<p>Arithmatic progression(AP) is a set in which the difference between 2 numbers in constant. for eg, 1,3,5,7,9 .... In this series the difference between 2 numbers is 2.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The task here is very simple indeed.</p> 
<p>You will be given the 3rd term , 3rd last term and the sum of the series. You need print length of the series &amp; the series.</p> 
<h3>Input</h3> 
<p>First line will contain a number indicating the number of test cases.</p> 
<p>Each of the following t lines will have 3 number '3term' ,'3Lastterm' and 'sum'</p> 
<p>3term  - is the 3rd term in of the series and</p> 
<p>3Lastterm  - is the 3rd term in of the series and</p> 
<p>sum - is the sum of the series.</p> 
<h3>Output</h3> 
<p>For each input of the test case, you need to print 2 lines.</p> 
<p>fist line should have 1 value- number of terms in the series.</p> 
<p>2nd line of the output should print the series numbers separated by single space.</p> 
<h3>Example</h3> 
<pre><strong>Input:</strong>
<pre><pre>1<br>3 8 55</pre>
<strong>Output:</strong>
<pre>10<br>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10</pre>
<strong>NOTE </strong>- In all the test cases all the series elements are positive integers.<br>The series will have at least 7 elements.<br>number of test cases &lt;=100.<br>All the numbers will fit in 64 bits(long long in C)</pre>
